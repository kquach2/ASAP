                <h1>Reach new markets</h1>
                <p>Hiring international students exposes you to new markets and opportunities for growth. Hiring people from other countries helps your company gain familiarity with and overcome cultural differences such as 
                    slang and etiquette. Additionally, international hires can help you overcome language barriers which is critical in expansion to new markets.

                <h1>Encourages Creativity and Perspectives</h1>
                <p>A global market approach to hiring rewards you with creativity and perspective. Hiring international employees brings talent with different perspectives into your company as they come from different backgrounds. 
                    Mixing perspectives from various cultures is quite possibly the best recipe for creativity and innovation. Creativity in the workplace has proven to positively influence work-life balance, employee self-development, collaboration and teamwork, engagement, motivation, and trust.

                <h1>Loyalty</h1>
                <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over half of recent college graduates will leave their first job within a year.
                    Young domestic employees tend to engage in job hopping until they find a job that they consider to be a good match with their interests and career goals.
                    This is not the case, however, for international grads. Being here on a visa, whether it is a traditional six-year H-1B work visa or an F-1 student visa with an OPT extension, makes it less attractive for international employees to play the field. 
                    It's not that they are prohibited from quitting a job but that doing so subjects them to a host of rules and reporting requirements. In addition, in some instances, doing so could jeopardize their immigration status.
                    Given this, don't make the mistake of believing that recent international graduates are just loyal out of necessity or convenience. They are legitimately grateful for the opportunity their employer has extended to them, often more so than domestic hires are.

                <h1>Independent and not afraid of challenges</h1>
                <p>International students left their home countries in order to challenge themselves in a new environment. 
                    By being here, they have already taken an initiative to step out of their comfort zone and take a risk â€” applying to a university abroad, flying across the world, living away from family, 
                    adapting to a new environment culturally and academically and going through complicated policies and paperwork. Instead of choosing a traditional, familiar path, they made a difficult
                    choice to challenge themselves, which will be reflected in their work ethic and the work they produce.

                <h1>Diversity</h1>
                <p>The benefits of a diverse workforce are fairly obvious and they have nothing to do with meeting quotas or political correctness.
                    Like your stock portfolio, diversity leads to an increase in performance. In 2017, Boston Consulting Group surveyed 1,700 companies in eight countries to research the work benefits of diversity. The group's study established that diverse teams drive innovation and that they produce 19 percent more revenue than their non-diverse counterparts.
                    When employers think about diversity, they often think about domestic talent. Hiring international graduates, however, can fulfill a whole host of diversity initiatives, from nationality to religion to language as well as to race and ethnicity.
                    Perhaps most importantly, international graduates bring diverse thinking styles and experiences which are qualities that can help your team solve a difficult problem, expand to other markets, or develop new technologies.
